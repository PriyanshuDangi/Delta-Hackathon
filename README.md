# Delta-Hackathon

### Introduction
Inspired from MOODI site, we thought of making the same for NIT-T. But in 30 hrs it was difficult to make that many models we implemented it for a city. You can also check other person location in the city.
We also thought of proximity chatting but were not able to do it because of time.
We used THREE.js and react-three-fiber for the frontend and rendering. Nodejs for the backend. We used sockets for user positions and will use will WEBrtc for voice chat.
