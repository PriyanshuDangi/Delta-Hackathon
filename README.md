# Delta-Hackathon

### Introduction
Inspired from MOODI site, we thought of making the same for NIT-T. But in 30 hrs it was difficult to make that many models we implemented it for a city. You can also check other person location in the city and can talk with them.
We used THREE.js and react-three-fiber for the frontend and rendering. Nodejs for the backend. We used sockets for user positions and WEBrtc for voice chat.
